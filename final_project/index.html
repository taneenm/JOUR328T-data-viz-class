      <h1>Gender Expression, Genres and Goodreads</h1>

    <p align="justify"> Since 2006, book fanatics across the world have been tracking their reading progress, reviewing books and following their favorite authors on Goodreads. In addition to tracking individual readers information, the social cataloging platform also tracks the performance of books and authors. I took a deeper dive into the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/popular_by_date/2021"> 15 most popular books</a> published each year and explored the gender expressions of the authors, what genres each of the 165 fit into and their.</p>

    <p align="justify"> I decided to study the gender expression, more specifically the pronouns, of these authors since the genders of all of them were not availble online, and pronouns do not equal gender. Additionally, I thought it would be interesting to see how common it was to use neutral or different pronouns, as it is a point of contention in the traditional literary community.</p>

    <p align="justify"> Although the number of ratings on Goodreads has been declining since 2019, the popularity of non-conforming authors seems to become more common as Casey McQuiston and V.E. Schwab trade places on the catalog's leaderboard. Perhaps one day there will be two on the top 15 most popular list at one time. </p>
